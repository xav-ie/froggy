# Welcome to the p5.js graphics on the web workshop!

1. Intro to p5.js.
 - What is it?
 - Where does it come from?
 - How does work?
2. Things you can make with p5.js
 - [Examples](https://p5js.org/examples/)
3. Get started!
 - [p5.js Home Page](https://p5js.org/)

Steps
1. Download this repository by first getting git on your computer and doing git clone https://github.com/xav-ie/froggy.git
2. Open the folder download in your editor of choice
3. Go to the index.html file, let's review how everything is working
- Make preload --> load in the image
- Make setup --> set the img variable
- Draw image to canvas (don't forget to make the canvas!)
- Move image based on mouseX and Mousey
- slow down the frog
- introduce collision detection with the mouse
- have game stop on collision
- game done! 

Next steps
- make the mouse a fly
- make froggy eyes
- perhaps have frog stay in place in it "casts" out a tongue!
- make object oriented!
